# BookingSystem
This repository contains a simple, mock booking system's REST API developed using .NET Core.

This repository has been published on Azure. Feel free to do a test run on : http://bookingfree.azurewebsites.net/

If you just want to look at what this API offers, I have set up the Swagger too! It is on: http://bookingfree.azurewebsites.net/swagger

Note:
From time to time, I will turn off the resources on Azure, so if it's not running, it's probably because of that :)

This repository is to showcase my skills and understanding on:
- .NET Core Web API
- Swagger
- Unit testing using Moq
- Repository pattern
- Azure WebApp
